# BioRhythm Analyzer

A **CTG Heart Failure Monitoring System** that processes Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) signals to detect potential abnormalities. This project combines advanced signal processing with an intuitive graphical interface for healthcare professionals.

- **Raw Signal:** Displays the original input signal for analysis.  
- **Filtered Signal:** Shows the cleaned, processed signal using advanced filtering techniques.  
- **HRV Metrics:** Visualizes key parameters such as SDNN, RMSSD, and pNN50 for heart rate variability analysis.  
- **Stats Section:** Includes detailed insights like mean RR intervals, outliers, histograms, and more.

## FHR Analysis

- **Baseline FHR:** Tracks the average fetal heart rate over time.  
- **Uterine Contraction:** Monitors the correlation between uterine contractions and FHR patterns.  
- **Short-Term Variability (STV):** Highlights rapid changes in FHR.  
- **Acceleration/Deceleration:** Detects anomalies with color-coded markers (green = normal, red = critical).
